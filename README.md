# Simulating Targeted Afforestation for Urban Heat Mitigation with ML
This repository houses the code for the paper *Targeted urban afforestation can reduce income-based heat disparities in U.S. cities*.

## Abstract

## Data availability
The data (which includes features, targets, demographics, and simualtions) is housed on Zenodo. The notebook 0-DataProcessing.ipynb aggregates and cleans the data. In 6a, we output simulations. 
- data.csv contains the features, targets, and demoograghics
- simulations.csv contains the simulations by census tract

## Running the code
1. Download the data from Zenodo and place it into the data folder.
2. Ensure all relevant packages are downloaded (see requirements.txt).
3. Run notebooks 1-6c.
   1. Notebooks 6a-6c require the models trained in notebook 5b.
